# Progress

## Working now

- manifest-backed DDD17 temporal loading: consecutive two-channel histogram bins or six-channel windows
- `model.py` exposes active DSEC/FPGA target `EventSpikeSegXL` and compact reference `EventSpikeSeg140k`
- frozen completed ten-model structural benchmark in `top_ten_models.py`
- completed structural top-five registry in `top_five_models.py`
- completed/frozen accuracy-oriented top-three registry in `top_three_models.py`
- PLIF with learnable beta and base thresholds
- local triangular threshold adaptation
- stem-only peer-membrane inhibition
- canonical independent spiking class populations with temporal spike-count semantic readout
- explicit 3- or 4-stage channel schedules
- configurable stem and first-block kernel size
- dynamic `enc4_spikes` activity/evaluation diagnostics for the deep contender

## Completed evidence

### Historical structural incumbent

`v10_fpga_hybrid`: mIoU 0.3130, pixel accuracy 0.7871, 44,016 parameters, output spike rate 0.1412 under the full round-one protocol.

### Latest neuron-mechanism screen

Protocol: seed 17, 5 epochs, 256 train, 128 held-out, 64×64, 8 internal timesteps.

| architecture | mIoU | pixel accuracy | spike rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `f05_v02_light_peer_membrane_inhibition` | 0.1991 | 0.7607 | 0.0616 |
| `f02_v10_plif_threshold_adaptation` | 0.1459 | 0.7395 | 0.0470 |
| `f01_v10_plif_threshold_wta` | 0.1402 | 0.7334 | 0.0457 |
| `f04_v03_dilated_threshold_adaptation` | 0.1366 | 0.7217 | 0.0513 |
| `f03_v10_plif_winner_peer_inhibition` | 0.1233 | 0.7384 | 0.0415 |

Selected mechanism base: PLIF + learnable threshold + stem peer-membrane inhibition + encoder triangular threshold adaptation.

## Completed structural top five

Protocol: seed 17, 8 epochs, 2,048 train, 512 held-out, 64×64, 15 timesteps, batch 14, LR 0.002.

| architecture | mIoU | parameters | useful evidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `f05_compact16_dilated` | **0.2596** | **21,491** | best overall/efficiency |
| `f02_wide32_multiscale` | 0.2284 | 77,751 | best object IoU in round |
| `f04_deep4_dilated` | 0.2079 | 107,131 | strongest aggregate rare-class signal |
| `f01_base24_multiscale` | 0.1626 | 46,423 | weak controlled baseline |
| `f03_early5x5_multiscale` | 0.1482 | 49,111 | early 5×5 rejected |

None beat the 0.3130 historical result under the then-current repeated-static input protocol. The architecture evidence remains useful, but those mIoU values are not direct baselines for the current temporal input protocol.

## Completed accuracy top three

- `t02_dualpath_detail` — **0.2728 mIoU**, 24,211 params; winner and evidence for a persistent high-resolution spiking detail stream.
- `t01_spike_pyramid_concat` — 0.1671 mIoU, 63,147 params; parallel multiscale concat did not recover accuracy.
- `t03_deep_attention_fpn` — 0.1555 mIoU, 108,781 params; extra depth/attention collapsed predictions toward dominant classes.

## Canonical candidate implemented

- 32/64/128 semantic path with projected residual bridges and extra residual DW/PW refinement;
- persistent 32-channel high-resolution detail path with asymmetric 3×1/1×3 refinement;
- serial dilation-2 context ×2 plus residual concatenated d1/d2/d4 context;
- one bottlenecked low-resolution spike-mask attention residual;
- concatenative mid-decoder fusion and late semantic/shallow/detail concatenation;
- local 96→96 PLIF 1×1 retinotopic spike selector (no count-domain MLP or frame barrier);
- two training-only auxiliary heads;
- independent spiking class neurons and temporal argmax;
- SpikingJelly `Conv2d`/PLIF/surrogate infrastructure where compatible, with project-specific per-channel beta, fInst, fLong and operation order preserved;
- canonical-only 70/20/10 joint → backbone-frozen refinement → low-LR joint-unfreeze schedule.

## Validation/cleanup state

- all architecture suites now dispatch through `train.py`; the duplicate standalone top-three trainer is retired;
- historical top-ten/top-five/top-three loss weights are explicit and separated from the final CE=1.0 profile;
- the generated `ddd17_temporal_manifest.json` is the required chronology source; the runtime neither generates it nor infers sequence boundaries from filenames;
- `timestamp-events` is the sole input representation; HDF5/raw and multi-file window paths are removed;
- one 50 ms record is scheduled over ten 5 ms input clocks and PLIF state persists across consecutive records;
- final best-checkpoint selection uses whole held-out sequences when available, otherwise one contiguous block;
- checkpoints fingerprint the manifest/split/physical-clock protocol and reject all older input protocols;
- auxiliary heads are skipped in evaluation/inference;
- native-resolution checkpoints are supported by `evaluate.py` when `output_size` is `None`;
- single-sequence contiguous validation and exact checkpoint holdout reconstruction are covered by regression tests; limited per-epoch training preserves temporal order; class-weight estimation reads masks only;
- obsolete `benchmark_top_three.py`, MEVDT/EventSCNN scripts, the dead `rtl-test` PowerShell wrapper, and checked-in `.ruff_cache` were removed; the completed DDD17 architecture-search plan is archived under `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.

## Open issues

- rare-class IoU remains the dominant accuracy limitation;
- the completed top-three hypotheses are measured only under the removed repeated-static protocol; the scaled canonical candidate has not yet been measured under the current temporal protocol;
- the installed training data is incomplete: 2,887 event tensors versus 10,001 masks, leaving only one event recording usable;
- with an 11-class DSEC head, XL registers 237,115 parameters and executes 226,767 at inference;
- learned continuous neuron dynamics and learned attention thresholds remain unquantized;
- `EventSpikeSegXL` is now the detailed 241x351 DSEC/FPGA implementation target; 140k remains the compact baseline.

## Next action

Run the 11-class XL DSEC configuration from scratch, then validate its float checkpoint,
fixed-point export, DDR-backed state traffic, and RTL branch/attention joins.

## 2026-08-15 timestamp-stream v3

- one dataset item is one 50 ms NumPy interval and its same-record indexed mask;
- stored `hist0,hist1,mean0,std0,mean1,std1` is decoded into per-polarity activity/mean/std;
- mean and mean±std schedule conserved synaptic activity before the first PLIF layer;
- DataLoader order is chronological, batch size is one, and fractions are contiguous;
- recurrent numeric state carries across records; training detaches its graph after each record;
- SpikingJelly's internal PLIF `v`/`w` references are also detached, removing a retained-graph RAM peak;
- `--internal-updates` defaults to 10 and is frozen into each checkpoint protocol;
- HDF5/raw readers, event-bin/sequential window datasets, T/stride flags, and raw compatibility commands are removed;
- model parameter count depends on class-head width: XL is 236,445 for six classes and 237,115 for eleven.


## 2026-08-19 FPGA implementation direction

- public model names remain `EventSpikeSegXL` and `EventSpikeSeg140k`; XL is the active implementation target;
- XL DSEC accounting: 237,115 registered / 232,059 training-forward / 226,767 inference-forward parameters;
- FPGA deployment omits inherited dead `refine2` and the training-only auxiliary head;
- primary hardware target is custom VHDL-2008 on Xilinx ZCU104;
- PLIF membrane/current/beta/threshold/adaptation are digital fixed-point SNN states, not physical voltages/currents;
- convolution kernels remain shared synaptic weights, while emitted hidden spikes are event addresses that trigger weight additions;
- no softmax exists in the canonical deployed path;
- coarse-grained synaptic-accumulator + PLIF processing elements are time-multiplexed across spatial tiles/channels/stages while persistent state stays in banked memory;
- first hardware milestone is bit-exact integer/RTL equivalence; sparse touched-address/lazy-decay/clock-enable optimizations follow only after exactness;
- DSEC training uses fixed physical-time count divisions; direct FPGA events use lazy physical-time decay and no global neural timestep;
- memory-bounded replay forms one complete-record objective before propagating its gradients through chronological chunks;
- remaining RTL-sensitive mechanisms are timestamp-based lazy decay, peer-membrane fInst, triangular fLong/TThresh, and the local PLIF selector;
- XL adds projected bridge joins, parallel-context joins, local Q/K/V rendezvous, and an external-DDR state-store requirement;
- evaluation flow is RTL simulation -> synthesis/place-route -> post-implementation timing -> representative SAIF/VCD Vivado power -> optional ZCU104 measurement.

### 2026-08-20 logical-state accounting

- compact-reference accounting separates 37 executed PLIF populations from the ~140k shared parameter count;
- general membrane formula: `(672+Nclass)*H*W + 480*H2*W2 + 1280*H4*W4`;
- six-class 212x282 DDD17 requires **52,524,272 independent membrane values**;
- fLong scopes cover **9,836,800 logical neurons** at that resolution, each with adaptation age and amplitude;
- implementation contract: static/shared weights and channel parameters, persistent per-`(layer,c,y,x)` neuron state, temporary current accumulators, sparse event FIFOs;
- exact sparse layer execution accumulates all weight contributions for a timestep before one PLIF threshold/reset update, then writes persistent state back and emits only fired addresses;
- a small physical PE array may be time-multiplexed, but logical state addresses may not be aliased; timestamp-based lazy decay is part of the bit-exact DSEC baseline.

### 2026-08-21 XL DSEC implementation accounting

- native dimensions: 241x351 -> 121x176 -> 61x88;
- 50 inference PLIF populations and 226,767 executed inference parameters;
- 85,639,973 membrane states plus 40,049,152 fLong age/amplitude values;
- one last-update timestamp per membrane state for direct asynchronous execution;
- illustrative exact persistent store: 566.42 MiB at membrane/fLong 16-bit and timestamp 32-bit;
- implementation memory: external DDR backing store with banked on-chip active-tile cache.
