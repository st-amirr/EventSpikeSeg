# Decisions

## 2026-08-05 — Reset from MEVDT tracking to DDD17 segmentation

Tracking, box decoding, alpha-beta tracking, global classification, and MEVDT metrics are inactive. The task is six-class semantic segmentation using the Ev-SegNet DDD17 representation.

## 2026-08-05 — Preserve the six event-statistic channels

The six channels are polarity histogram, timestamp mean, and timestamp standard deviation pairs. They are repeated as direct current over internal SNN steps and are not reinterpreted as chronological bins.

## 2026-08-06 — Preserve the completed ten-model experiment separately

Round one completed with `v10_fpga_hybrid` highest at mIoU 0.3130. The complete preset registry is moved to `top_ten_models.py`; it remains reproducible but is no longer part of the canonical production module.

## 2026-08-06 — Keep model.py canonical-only

`model.py` contains one architecture interface. It currently installs the measured round-one incumbent. Experimental architectures belong in explicit experiment files and may not be added back to `model.py`.

## 2026-08-06 — Run a spike-native top-five round

The second round tests combinations derived from v10, v03, v02, and v08 using PLIF, feature-map `f_long`, explicit `T_thresh`, and selected hidden-layer `f_inst`. Ordinary BN and GAP gating are not included because this round targets mechanisms that remain meaningful during neuromorphic inference.

## 2026-08-06 — Do not enable f_inst in every contender

Cross-channel winner-take-all may improve sparsity but can remove simultaneous semantic features. It is therefore isolated to two of five contenders rather than treated as automatically beneficial.

## 2026-08-06 — Treat PLIF as trainable, not yet hardware-exact

PLIF learns continuous per-channel retention. The eventual FPGA model must quantize it to an integer-friendly leak, then run accuracy and bit-exact regression tests before PLIF can be claimed as deployed.

## 2026-08-06 — Round-one zero-IoU classes are an open data/training issue

Object and human class performance cannot be solved by architecture ranking alone. Before final selection, record class pixel counts, image-presence counts, prediction counts, and confusion matrices at the benchmark resolution.
